# LEARN TOGETHER

I'm currently learning to become a Fullstack Web Developer, enrolled as an online student at Flatiron School to help me get there. What I've learned about the Tech Industry is that it's a culture. A helpful community with vast amounts of knowlegde and wisdom. If you're anything like me, you need all the help you can get. I find myself constantly bookmarking sites and reaching out on slack channels or looking back at previous conversations where I think I might have seen someone talk about a certain error I'm getting, or a simpler way to write the code I want.

The goal of this application is to allow students to share additional resources they found helpful as they were going through one of the 8 topics we learn. Simply name the resource and add the link and it'll be available to see on the respective topic page. Let's learn together...happy coding!

# INSTALLATION 

The easiest way to see my application running is to follow this link: https://learn-together-app.herokuapp.com/

You can also clone this respository, run bundle install, run rake db:migrate then run rake db:seed.  After you're finished setting that up, open your browser and head to localhost:3000

Enjoy!
